Arcane armor:
  No clue how you're balancing the stats, lad. Just add defence for the duration of the battle, make it cost alot of mana and only be used once per battle

Fireball:
  Splash damage, medium damage, fair mana usage

summon clam:
  Clam fights for you, takes enemy aggro, not much health but plenty of defence, I will take no questions.

Lightning: 
  Single target, lots of damage, fair mana usage
